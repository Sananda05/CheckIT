5 Applications of Machine Learning in Software Engineering:

1. Wecan apply Machine Learning for Detecting the repeating line or unnecessary &
unused variables and methods from a code snippet.

2. In Facebook, there’s a feature “Automatic Face detection” while uploading photo which
is based on Machine Learning’s algorithm.

3. By Machine Learning’s algorithm, we can Convert a code snippet written in java into
another language like C++ or python.

4. It’s possible to ensure the Fraud detection (Fake id, Fake accounts) while developing a
software by Machine Learning algorithm.

5. Wecan also Write a code by converting voice into text. Which is basically Machine
Learning’s Voice recognition algorithm.
